# **SQL Practice Projects – Northwind & World Databases**

This repository contains SQL exercises and analytical queries using the **Northwind** and **World** sample databases.  
It includes a structured workbook of tasks and solutions covering business-oriented analysis (Northwind) and global geographic/demographic analysis (World).  
All queries are written for learning, practice, and portfolio demonstration.
